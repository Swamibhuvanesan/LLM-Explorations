# AI-ML-Explorations

Welcome to the **AI-ML-Explorations** repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing my journey and projects in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Here, you'll find a collection of diverse projects, experiments, and explorations that I have undertaken.

## üß† About This Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of my work in AI and ML. It includes a variety of projects, from practical implementations of machine learning models to explorations of cutting-edge AI techniques. Some of the highlights include:

- **Huggingface Projects**: Implementations and experiments using the Huggingface library, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformer models.
- **Gemini Clone**: A personal project where I attempt to clone or replicate features of the Gemini AI model.
- **Various AI/ML Experiments**: A collection of smaller projects and experiments that showcase different aspects of AI and ML, including data science, model training, and algorithm optimization.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Huggingface-Projects**: Contains all projects and experiments related to the Huggingface library.
- **Gemini-Clone**: Contains the development and iterations of the Gemini AI model clone.
- **Experiments**: Includes various smaller projects and experimental works in AI and ML.

## üöÄ Getting Started
